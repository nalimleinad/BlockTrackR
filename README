BlockTrackR
--

BlockTrackR is currently under heavy development. 
The end goal is a product that monitors major world events such as block breaks, block placement, and item usage.

This data will be written to a SQL database for storage and will be accesiable via in-game command or by way of the provided tool (TODO).
A front-end web interface is also planned for easy access to the data from an out-of-game environment.

BlockTrackR is currently being written for CraftBukkit-1.7.10 but will be ported to 1.8 when it has attained a stable state.

BlockTrackR will always be compiled with Java 7. Please consider this if you find yourself with concurrency errors.
