BlockTrackR
---

Minecraft monitoring plugin designed to capture, index, and correlate real-time data in a searchable repository.

Currently only supports MySQL. All SQL processes actuate asynchronously and take advantage of connection pooling thanks to HikariCP.

This project is built against Java 1.7, the Sponge API, and utilizes Gradle for build automation.
